            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p><strong>Dutch/Moluccan communications and multi-media designer, based in Amsterdam. 
            Bachelor’s student of Communication and Multi-media Design at HvA (Hogeschool van Amsterdam).</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Esi Tanala – They who gaze/see</strong>, a (possible) translation of my family name “Sitanala” 
                in Asilulu, an almost forgotten language of Maluku. </p><p> <strong>Pa’o (Asilulu for “descendants”)</strong> 
                – As a descendant of the Moluccan KNIL soldiers who were forced to migrate to the 
                Netherlands, I have a task of decolonisation. A struggle that is of importance to 
                me as a designer, to create awareness of my culture in the Netherlands and to give 
                a voice through my designs.</p>

            <h2>INTERESTS</h2>
            <p><strong>As a designer I care about ; personality, cultural identity, timeless designs, designs that matter.</strong></p>
            <h3>Designing for Culture & Identity</h3>
            <p>I am drawn to projects that explore the essence of a place, 
                a community, or a heritage. Whether it’s a family-owned 
                creperie in Lithuania, Moluccan intergenerational history, 
                or a student bar, I seek to capture the identity of people 
                and places through design.</p>
            <h3>Design with Meaning</h3>
            <p>I don’t design for surface-level aesthetics alone. My work aims 
                to connect with deeper layers of meaning — storytelling, 
                inclusivity, emotional resonance, and cultural sensitivity. 
                For me, design should matter to those who see it, use it, 
                and live with it.</p>
            <h3>Research-Driven Creation</h3>
            <p>I love combining creative methods with research — 
                digging into history, language, personas, or user 
                behavior to inform design decisions. This ensures 
                the results are grounded, thoughtful, and relevant.</p>
            <h3>Expressing Personal & Collective Stories</h3>
            <p>Some of my most meaningful projects come from personal or 
                cultural roots. I am interested in using design as a 
                medium to express memory, identity, and even pain, in 
                ways that can connect with others emotionally.</p>
