		<h2>DE AFDELING</h2>
		<p><strong>Outside my study I ran a student bar, from january 
            2024 till january 2026, together with a team of driven students 
            from all different disciplines. During this time my task was to 
            change and refresh Café de Afdeling’s visual identity and setup 
            a ‘design system’ for future students so they a standard to work with.</p>
            <p>As Promotions, I introduced and shaped the role yourself, giving the bar 
                a unified and evolving visual identity. You manage both digital (social 
                media, fast responses) and physical (posters, flyers, designs) promotions, 
                ensuring the bar remains professional, relevant, and vibrant.</p>
            <p>I emphasized inclusivity in all communications—making the bar’s identity open, 
                welcoming, and accessible, while also protecting it as a neutral space free of 
                divisive or alienating messages.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Organized & Reliable → keeping communication structured and efficient.</li>
                <li>Creative and Cohesive → crafting and evolving a cohesive brand identity.</li>
                <li>Initiative-Taker → creating the Promotions role and shaping its importance.</li>
                <li>Community-Minded → seeing the bar as a living, breathing hub that adapts with its people.</li>
                <li>Inclusive & Responsible → ensuring designs and messages are welcoming to all.</li>
                <li>Professional & Consistent → balancing creativity with clarity and reliability.</li>
