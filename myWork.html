		<h2>DE AFDELING</h2>
		<p><strong>Outside my study I ran a student bar, from january 
            2024 till january 2026, together with a team of driven students 
            from all different disciplines. During this time my task was to 
            change and refresh Café de Afdeling’s visual identity and setup 
            a ‘design system’ for future students so they a standard to work with.</strong></p>
            <p>As Promotions, I introduced and shaped the role yourself, giving the bar 
                a unified and evolving <strong>visual identity</strong>. I managed both digital (social 
                media and online marketing) and physical (posters, cover art and flyers) promotions, 
                ensuring the bar remains professional, relevant, and vibrant.</p>
            <p>I emphasized <strong>inclusivity</strong> in all communications—making the bar’s identity open, 
                welcoming, and accessible, while also protecting it as a neutral space free of 
                divisive or alienating messages.</p>

		<h2>WHOPPAH</h2>
		<p><strong>In my studies of Communication & Multimedia Design (CMD), the focus lies in creating 
            digital interfaces while keeping the user experience central in every outcome.</strong></p>
            <p>Within the <strong>Commercial Design</strong> course, I worked on a project for Whoppah, a company 
                specializing in repurposed furniture. My task was to analyze and design improvements 
                to Whoppah’s website with a commercial mindset, focusing on the buyer persona and how 
                design choices influence purchasing behavior. I presented my findings and design 
                proposals directly to Whoppah’s marketing team, combining both creative and commercial 
                perspectives.</p>

		<h2>NOTICING WATER</h2>
		<p><strong>During your Minor in Creative Research, I explored a wide range of research methods, 
            both established and self-developed, applying them to different topics.</strong></p>
            <p>I gained experience <strong>working individually and in teams</strong>, adapting my approach depending 
                on the project’s needs. I also hosted research workshops, participatory workshops and 
                interviews, creating networks where sharing methods and insights with others in interactive 
                ways is the fruit. A key part of my development was designing my own <strong>creative research methods</strong>, 
                which encouraged experimentation, reflection, and innovation.</p>
                <p>Withing Carlo DeGaetano's research "Noticing Water" he invited me and my team to create our
                    own workshop where we could combine research methods and add on to his existing research.
                    For this participatory workshop I created an <strong>Immersive Experience</strong>, within 
                    HvA's Immersive Lab, where the participants can notice the research in a 360 degrees projected space.

		<h2>GITANOS BLYNAI</h2>
		<p><strong>Gitanos Blynai is a beloved family-owned crêperie in Lithuania, recognized locally and 
            awarded as one of the best family-run businesses in their town.
        </strong></p>
            <p>I was tasked with designing their menu, not only as a functional piece but as a reflection 
                of their identity—community spirit, family values, and quality. To strengthen this identity, 
                I engaged with the young art students working at the crêperie, inviting them to illustrate 
                the town in their own unique styles. By incorporating their artwork into the menu design, 
                the result celebrated both the business’s connection to its community and its role in giving 
                students their first side jobs. The menu needed to be more than a list of dishes—it needed 
                to tell the story of the town, the family, and the people who bring the place to life.

		<h2>ESI TANALA</h2>
		<p><strong>As part of my Immersive Environments minor, I created an individual project for the 
            exhibition titled “Esi Tanala” (They Who Gaze).
        </strong></p>
            <p>The work grew out of a lifelong, very personal research into the intergenerational trauma 
                of the Moluccan people in the Netherlands. My goal was to express a pain I carry within 
                myself and translate it into an experience others could feel as well. I told my supervisor: 
                “I want to express this feeling that makes me cry, and I want it to make at least someone 
                else cry.”
            </p>
            <p>To build the concept, I gathered archival materials such as images of Moluccan protests, 
                the arrival of Moluccan people, and other fragments of cultural memory. My cousin, who 
                studies Asilulu (an almost forgotten old Moluccan language), helped me with my research 
                and came up with the title Esi Tanala. This gave me the idea to create a somewhat silent 
                projection piece, where I projected my family on a white backdrop, gazing directly into 
                the eyes of the audience. The final work became an intimate, confronting moment of shared 
                gazes—an invitation to witness memory, grief, and resilience through silence.</p>

		<h2>REFRESH MEDIA</h2>
		<p><strong>For about 3–4 months, I worked at Refresh Media as an intern, a small but long-established company, 
            where I contributed to designing UX websites, web applications, UIs, and visuals.
        </strong></p>
            <p>During this time, I learned to create simple website layouts with Elementor 
                (a WordPress web application) that Refresh Media could quickly adapt for their clients.
                I also worked in Adobe XD (UX design) to help design pages within larger web applications built 
                for big businesses, focusing on their specific professional needs.
            </p>
            <p>Beyond client projects, I also contributed to renewing Refresh Media’s own identity—by 
                creating illustrations, icons, and even a new logo concept. The company had been around 
                for a long time, and I felt they could use a fresh perspective in how they presented 
                themselves. Interestingly, about half a year after my internship ended, the owner 
                messaged me to share their new website. To my surprise, they had also updated their 
                logo—not exactly my design, but similar in spirit</p>

		<h2>SKETCHNOTING</h2>
		<p><strong>I learned sketchnoting during my studies at CMD HvA. It was encouraged as a trait: 
            sketching in between writing down things in lectures or seminars.
        </strong></p>
            <p>For example in Design 
            History classes, I often sketched away, using visuals to capture ideas, connections, and 
            emotions that purely text-based notes didn’t convey.
            Through doing this, I developed not just a habit, but also an awareness of how combining sketches, 
            diagrams, icons, and keywords can make information more memorable, more engaging, and more 
            personally meaningful.

                <li>What is sketchnoting: It’s visual note taking: using sketches, symbols, structures, text to record thoughts in a creative way, not just copying what’s heard.</li>
                <li>Improved comprehension & memory: The combination of words + visuals engages more areas of the brain, making it easier to recall information and understand relationships between concepts.</li>
                <li>Greater focus & engagement: Sketchnoting forces active listening: you have to pick out what’s important, decide what to visualise, and pay attention so you don’t miss the flow of a lecture. This reduces distractions.</li>
                <li>Encouraging creativity & personal style: Since you don’t have to be “good at drawing,” you can develop your own style of icons, layouts, structures. Over time, you build a “visual vocabulary.”</li>
                <li>Structure and clarity: Best practices include using a hierarchy (titles → sub-points), using containers, connectors (arrows, boxes), icons, consistent typography, and limited color palettes to highlight, so that notes are easy to scan later.</li>
